# in-depth-scroll

Template and build process for building a scrolly element inside an In-depth article. This is still very much a work in progress. Inspired by the excellent work here: https://www.floridatoday.com/in-depth/news/2019/10/24/excited-delirium-custody-deaths-gregory-edwards-melbourne-taser/2374304001/


## Getting started
This template uses Node with Parcel as the build tool. If you don't already have parcel installed:
`npm install -g parcel-bundler`

To develop:
`npm run dev`

To build a production version:
`npm run build`
